# HTNE
Hackathon project for hack the northeast.

## My contribution
Created a LSTM model for sentiment analysis of input text messages to determine whether or not we should 
try and cheer up the user.

Utilized GloVe embeddings as a form of pre-training so that our model would generalize better by learning the 
vector similarities that exist within word embeddings
